# Geckoboot bootloader

The Geckoboot bootloader is a USB Mass Storage and DFU boot loader for Silabs Happy Gecko microcontrollers.

It is small (fits in under 4K), and has been tested to work well on a wide variety of operating systems (different versions of Linux, Windows, Mac and BSD).

It works with the [original Geckonator][geckonator-hw] and the [Geckonator Dev Edition][geckonator-dev] and has also been used on the [2017 Bornhack Badge][bornhack-badge-2017] and the [2018 Bornhack badge][bornhack-badge-2018]

The Geckoboot bootloader uses the [Geckonator][geckonator] library, that can also be used for general development on the Happy Gecko family of microcontrollers.
